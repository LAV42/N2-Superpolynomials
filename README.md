# N2-Superpolynomials
Maple programs for calculations with N=2 symmetric Superpolynomials including N=2 Jack


This code has been produced in research context and so it is a bit of a mess. 

This is written in the Maple language. It is intended for experts looking for experimenting with N=2 superpolynomials. 
To get started simply navigate to the directory and run the following in maple

    read "loadlib.mpl";

A N=1 symmetric superpolynomials framework has been developed in Sage and can be found at:

This code is much cleaner and a user guide is provided.
